      <h2>International Destinations</h2>
      <p>
        <p>According to Laura Jeeves (an experienced adventure traveller) in his blog called "5 Hot Backpacking
          Destinations you Don't Want to Miss". We will only mention 3 of them:</p>


        <div id="destinations">
          <header>

            <h3> South Africa</h3>

            <p>For wildlife-lovers, South Africa is the place to be. Save up for a Big Five safari as it will be the
              experience of a lifetime. However, natural wonders are all around: gape at the penguins in Cape Town
              before training up your palate visiting the famous vineyards further inland.</p>

            <h3> Thailand</h3>

            <p>Thailand has long been a favourite with backpackers; it is hardly surprising given its stunning beaches,
              epic parties and enchanting culture. First-time visitors should definitely catch one of the Full Moon
              parties that bring the beaches to life once a month. However, don’t be one of those travellers who come
              for the parties and see nothing else. Discover the jungles, explore the cities and get to know the
              country better before you leave.</p>

            <h3> Nepal</h3>

            <p>Nepal’s popularity has been growing over the last year as more and more people discover its gentle
              beauty set under the towering Himalayas. With over 130 heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley alone,
              time spent here is spent well. The mountains provide serious hikers with plenty to do, but easy, shorter
              routes are perfect for casual visitors..</p>
