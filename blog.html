        <p>The reasons to travel are incalculable due to the fact they depend on every person. You travel to destroy
          the
          routine, to take away from every day life, to get to understand and ride new cultures firsthand, to
          see "that" temple or monument that has made you so a lot sigh when you admire it in photos. It also
          travels to meet people, to meet oneself, to understand their personal limits and even to blur them
          and trace them "a little further." You tour with the aid of adrenaline, for the love of travel, for
          pleasure to the unknown and for fear of the unknown. You travel certainly due to the fact you like
          it.Traveling means to be voluntarily exposed to a drastic change of habits and routines.
          Means to Get up every day in a different place and in a different environment.</p>
